# Face-Recognization

This is Face-Recognization project.

This tutorial was designed for easily diving into TensorFlow, through examples. For readability, it includes both notebooks and source codes with explanation, for both TF v1 & v2.

It is suitable for beginners who want to find clear and concise examples about TensorFlow. Besides the traditional 'raw' TensorFlow implementations, you can also find the latest TensorFlow API practices (such as `layers`, `estimator`, `dataset`, ...).


## Dataset
Some examples require MNIST dataset for training and testing. Don't worry, this dataset will automatically be downloaded when running examples.
MNIST is a database of handwritten digits, for a quick description of that dataset, you can check [this notebook](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/0_Prerequisite/mnist_dataset_intro.ipynb).

## Installation

To download all the examples, simply clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/wonderTechi/Face-Recognization
```

To run them, you also need the latest version of TensorFlow. To install it:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

or (with GPU support):
```
pip install tensorflow_gpu
```
